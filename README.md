# Sports_website
This is a sports website project created by three people (Aayushi J, Prabhav R, and Anirudh S) as a team as part of 2nd semester projects.
This project contains information about WWE, IPL, and NBA sports with data as of 2022.
For other sports, the website is linked to the ESPN main website.
All the webpages are interconnected to each other to give a website experience, with navigation provided on the top bar itself.
This project will work when all the folders are downloaded into the D drive and the main webpage is Sportswebsite stored inside the WWE folder.
